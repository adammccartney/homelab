kubernetes at home
==================

This repo is a collection of ansible for provisioning kubernetes in a
homelab environment. The homelab is a proxmox cloud platform running on
an old Lenovo ThinkCentre 920q.

The ansible scripts in book-of-k8s/setup are borrowed from
[examples](https://github.com/book-of-kubernetes/examples) included with
The Book of Kubernetes and were originally created by Alan Hohn, who
also owns the copyright.
